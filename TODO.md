* Undo change to perf tests since this PR may not include updates to move to minified bundles
* Get feedback on createElement vs h
* Try to get VSCode intellisense to work in compat tests
	* Perhaps put a local jsconfig.json that changes pragma to React? Or should we just import createElement from preact/compat?
